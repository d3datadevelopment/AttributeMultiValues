# Multiple value assignment to attributes

This package supports the multiple assignment of attribute values. This allows you to describe your articles in more detail and offer more flexible filters.

Instead of 
* Colour: yellow
* Material: cotton

you can now maintain further details:
* Color: yellow
* Colour: black
* Material: cotton
* Material: Polyester

These additional filter options can be used in our [advanced search](https://packagist.org/packages/d3/extsearch) module, for example.
